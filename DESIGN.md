 Maps of Europe
  - with no drug selected
    - time slide
      - map coloring by selecting overdose deaths / infectious disease / HSR
      - overdose deaths
        - total overdose deaths: n (corrected for population size), mean age: n
      - infectious disease notifications (corrected for population size)
        - HIV: n, AIDS: n
      - health and social responses (corrected for population size)
        - OST clients: n, NSP clients: n
    - topics clickable for trend
      - current year in different color in bar chart
    - amount clickable for comparisson to other countries (thus corrected for population size)
      - current country in different color in bar chart
