### Decomposition


**Challenges**

### Features, interactivity


### Limitations and troubleshooting

- The amount of available data differs strongly over the years and in between countries. In order for patterns to emerge clearly still, a clever way of visualisation has to be found.
- The way data has been obtained for each and every country differs. The provided data hopefully shows interesting trends supported by their reasonable comparability.
- Units of measurement for different forms of drugs need to be incorporated without distracting from the message
- Treatmant demand in relation to population size/amount of frequent users?
- The non-drug specific data (death and disease, health and social responses) should be incorporated with some relation to the drug specific data, in order to confer a specific message.
