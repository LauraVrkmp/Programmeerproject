## Report on programming project by Laura Veerkamp

### description

screen shot like !dataselection](/doc/dataselection.jpg)

### technical design

how is functionality implemented in your code. high level overview, what components are there in my code. Then detail on javscript files

### challenges/changes to design document 

**(what have you learned)**

challenges

trend vs. year specifics +
country vvs. total of europe +
disease vs. NSP - (data sets are not complementing each other ^)	
youth part of prevalence
AIDS and HIV in disease not cummulatively shown
deaths not decomposed on toxicology: cases with opiates, without opiates, unknown
history vs no history in treament topic
seizures vs. policy of country
units of measurement +
worked well with available data, just development over the years in between countries hard to say


changes

data is shown initially, just not country specific
menu in the form of buttons, dropdown and radio buttons
no time, need for arcs/chord diagram for drug origins
didn't put line graph and/or bar chart over map for insight

### defend decisions in single paragraph, how to improve

data sets are not complementing each other, as in quote:
    - Quote: 'In particular, information on patterns of drug use, 
	such as primary drug and injecting behaviour, complement estimates of the 
	prevalence of problem drug use (PDU), drug-related infectious diseases (DRID) 
	and drug-related deaths (DRD).'
	
	no disease vs. NSP
	no treament demand vs. frequent users (montly prevalence)

not super clear where data is missing in each figure

click country in bar chart for update map and line graph
click year in line graph for update map and bar chart
average age of deaths should be turned around
purity/potency: quality of product (%), dangers of conc. levels
no correction for population size
cannot say more on applicability of data to reality: obbey data source. Trends visible, hope for comparability
